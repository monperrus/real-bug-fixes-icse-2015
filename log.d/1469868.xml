<D:comment>DERBY-6183 rlliso2multi and rlliso3multi failing with [WARNING 01004: Data truncation]

backported change #1469445 from trunk to 10.9 branch.

Removed casts from lock_table2 view, which was only used in a few
places. I was not able to reproduce, but assumption is that a
system background lock when running full suite sometimes triggered
a problem with the cast.

<D:comment>DERBY-5567 AlterTableTest#testDropColumn fails: drop view cannot be performed due to dependency

Backported from trunk with some minor edits (imports).

When a view (b) is defined on another view (a), dropping a column in
the base table can lead to both view being invalidated. This patch
(DERBY-5567-1) fixes a problem in the logic:

Depending on the order in which dependencies of the base table column
are registered, the invalidation will happen either view a or view b.
If it happens on view a first, this view in turn will try to
invalidate view b (since that depends on view a), but with the
DROP_VIEW action which fails. The patch changes this recursive
invalidation to use the original action, e.g. DROP_COLUMN which will
allow dropping the dependent view (dropping a column is allowed to
cause cascading drops of dependent views).

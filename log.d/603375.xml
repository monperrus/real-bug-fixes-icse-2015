In the case of a wait for a latch while traveling left at leaf level, and
a subsequent wait for either a lock or another latch while looking for row
to lock then one path through the code would get a null pointer.  The code
was trying to release a latch that had already been released and was tracked
by "current_leaf == null".

I could not get this to fail in my environment, but did force it by code
inspection and changing the path through the code by hand to mimic latch
waits.  My assumption is that intermittently on some platforms this single
threaded test is competing for these latches with background deleted row
cleaner thread, probably on a fast multiple processor machine.

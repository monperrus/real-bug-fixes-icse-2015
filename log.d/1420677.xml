<D:comment>Hopefully fix the nightly Maven build:
- The artifact creation never "installed" the artifacts in the local repository, so the validate task depended on downloading them -&gt; which was wrong.
- The jenkins-maven-nightly target now runs actually 2 builds: One that deploys to apache repo using ANT, installs locally and validates the artifacts with the locally installed versions; after that it runs the maven-based build with "mvn"</D:comment>

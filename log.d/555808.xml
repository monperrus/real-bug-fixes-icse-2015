<D:comment>DERBY-2931, backporting from trunk to 10.3

In soft upgrade mode the format id of the new heap format was being written
out along with the old format metadata.  On reboot system would try to read
new format and fail.  Problem was that wrong format id was associated with
the soft upgrade version of the heap conglomerate class (Heap_v10_2.java).

The code change is just changing that format id from
StoredFormatIds.ACCESS_HEAP_V3_ID to StoredFormatIds.ACCESS_HEAP_V2_ID.  The
rest of the changes is comments in the code and updates to the upgrade test
suite.  The changes to the upgrade suite showed the problem before the fix in
both 10.3 branch and trunk and then passed once the fix was applied.  Adding
those tests actually caused some other tests in the upgrade suite to fail
which passed previously, and those cases were also fixed by this change.

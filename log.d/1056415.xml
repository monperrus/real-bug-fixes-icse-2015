<D:comment>Backporting the changes for DERBY-4874 to 10.5 codeline. This backport to 10.5 has been the migration of changes committed to 10.6,
DERBY-4874 Trigger does not recognize new size of VARCHAR column expanded with ALTER TABLE. It fails with ERROR 22001: A truncation error was encountered trying to shrink VARCHAR

The backport of DERBY-4874 from trunk to 10.6 codeline was done by hand (rather than a simple migration from trunk) because the changes in trunk depended on DERBY-1482. DERBY-1482 can't be backported to 10.6 and earlier because it had required system level changes which can't be backported to pre-released Derby products.

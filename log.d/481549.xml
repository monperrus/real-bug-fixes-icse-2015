<D:comment>Fixed the trail (thanks Marvin) in skinconf and put in a temporary feather logo for the left image.
Added in developer-resources.xml that contains info on contributing, downloading nightly builds and getting code from SVN and added it under the resources section.
Fixed the news release item on the main page to be Nov. 26
Added in links to previous versions of site under the Site Versions so that we have links.  These sites have been downloaded and are available on the website, just not linked to until now</D:comment>

Yeah, it's actually \"double encoded\"... \r\n\r\nI know. I wasn't talking about the HTTP layer, I was referring to the servlet spec where the encoding for query string parsing in URIs is not defined and form-encoded POSTs are to use ISO-8859-1 by default. So neither Jetty nor Tomcat are \"right\" in how they handle parameter parsing from URIs, it was just underspecified from the beginning.\r\n\r\nWhen you add the HTTP layer above things get even more confusing because, according to the spec, HTTP headers must be in US-ASCII. This includes the URI line so any character outside of US-ASCII (including your example) is a violation of the HTTP protocol. In practice (perhaps sadly) the rules and implementations are much more relaxed and just accept any bytes (until eols) (as per your curl example).\r\n\r\nIn theory it should be quite simple: if the encoding cannot be determined otherwise (from the origin page for forms, etc.) then it should be UTF-8 encoded, then URL-escaped. In practice you get all the combinations of behaviors both on the browser/http client side and on the server side.\r\n\r\nTalking about this -- I think I know what IE is trying to do. Since the URL you're typing in the browser is pretty much an indication where to send a GET request + the resource locator (URI) of the resource you're trying to access (which will end up in the HTTP header section), it's probably trying it's best to convert non-ASCII characters to their ASCII equivalents. So \"ł\" becomes \"l\" etc. If my explanation is anywhere near right then you need to admit it does make some sense... although it is absolutely useless and absurd in practical terms since any resource accessible via 'ł' in its path shouldn't be aliased to \"l\": (pl) \"łał\" -> (en) \"whoa\", \"lał\" -> ([he] was pissing)...\r\n\r\nTalk about standards, eh? :)\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"created":"2013-01-05T09:49:25.774+0000","updated":"2013-01-05T09:49:25.774+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626085/comment/13544663","id":"13544663","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"Some fun with IE and non-ASCII parameters.

This makes code more clean. StnadrdRequestParser just delegates\r\n- The POST form data now is also limited in size as given in SolrConfig (like multipart messages). Defaults to 2 MB. This was also done previously in Jetty, but not configureable through solrconfig. Now its at one place and consistent between all servlet containers.\r\n- when posting form data but also give parameters in URL, the URL form contents appear *before* the POST form data. This is also how it is done in Jetty/Tomcat. This only affects duplicate parameters. Also I fixed the previous code to use UTF-8 always for the URL form data, but for the POSTed one the content-type is visited.\r\n- Some cleanups in the other Solr servlets, also reenable POST is the ZookeeperInfoServlet (it now uses SolrRequestParsers - so all servlets are consistent in how they get input parameters)\r\n\r\nI want to commit this later this evening. I hope all is fine. If you have some time, you can check it.\r\n\r\nIt might be good to backport this to 3.6.3 (if it comes out), as this is a serious issue for many people using Tomcat instead of Jetty and that don't read the Solr Wiki how to correctly configure their container.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-01-05T14:37:45.350+0000","updated":"2013-01-05T14:37:45.350+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626085/comment/13544735","id":"13544735","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"I am currently investigation to be more srict with parameter encoding: Currently it is not an error if the %-encoded terms are not valid UTF-8 (URLDecoder of JDK replaces all invalid chars with ?).

Namely, if you have a POST form, with a target URL that contains (unescaped) unicode characters, the browser will use the originating page's encoding for both POST parameters and the URL. Say, something like:\r\n{code}\r\n    <form action=\"echo.jsp?abc=łódź\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">\r\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"blah\"><br>\r\n      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\r\n    </form>    \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nEnforcing UTF-8 but respecting POST encoding for the body seems like we're creating custom rules which, given the mess we talked about above, should probably be avoided.

If decoder failures occur, return HTTP BAD_REQUEST.\r\n\r\nThe advantage here is that these rules won't surprise people that have simple HTML forms (for some reason with partial query string already hardcoded in the action attribute).

The URL is invalid in the HTML source but browsers will \"fix\" it for you (url-escape) and many people accept it as something ordinary.\r\n\r\nThats the whole problem, I agree. But we don't know what the browser used as encoding for encoding the URL. So without a charset given somewhere we cannot decode the URL. You have the problem with GET and POST requests. Because of this you cannot fix this for SOLR.\r\n\r\nThe patch does not change any behaviour in guessing charsets from before, the *only* change here is the encoding used to decode URLs (which is now \"UTF-8\" because several web containers handle this in a different way). Jetty and Tomcat both handled POST content respecting the charset of the POST BODY - and that did not change.\r\n\r\nWhere is your problem with Solr? The whole discussion could be flame-wared on the Jetty or Tomcat lists as before, unfortunately the HTTP spec and the Servlet spec and the URL spec are not precise enough. For Solr it is not an issue: Solr is documented to only accept URL encoded request parameters as UTF-8.\r\n\r\nThe only way to change this would be to do it like search engine. They allow to pass in an \"ie=\" extra GET parameter that defines the \"input encoding\" of the URL parameters. In that case you could do a 2-step URL parsing approach (or use commons-codec: decode the binary url from the byte[] and then interpret the \"ie\" parameter as US-ASCII and use it to decode the remaining parameters.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-01-05T17:48:24.549+0000","updated":"2013-01-05T17:48:24.549+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626085/comment/13544775","id":"13544775","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"bq.

We were calculating a box the size that would completely fit inside the circle rather than vice-versa.  This was caused by taking the distance and projecting it out to calculate the corners of the box.  But the distance given should really be to the side of the box... and the distance from the center to the corner of the box should be greater (if the box is to completely encompass the circle).\r\n\r\nThe fix should be easy - the distance to the corner of the box is sqrt(2) * dist_to_side_of_box.  So internally we just need to multiply the distance by sqrt(2) before finding the corners.\r\n\r\nGrant is coding up the fix and tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2010-09-21T14:45:00.092+0000","updated":"2010-09-21T14:45:43.820+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12474641/comment/12913035","id":"12913035","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"More chatting with Grant - sqrt(2) is correct if things are flat, but prob not correct for a bounding box on the surface of a sphere.\r\nAnother thought is toproject left, right, up, and down to the sides of the box and use those lat ranges and lon ranges directly as the bounding box.\r\n\r\nThe crazy thing is that this is basic geo code - isn't there some bounding box calculation code out there we can use or at least reference?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2010-09-21T15:36:20.529+0000","updated":"2010-09-21T15:36:20.529+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12474641/comment/12913126","id":"12913126","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=billnbell","name":"billnbell","emailAddress":"bell dot william at comcast dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bill Bell","active":true},"body":"Grant: Can you give a good example using the same measurements for sorting and sfilt ?\r\n\r\nWill this work?

The Local Solr from Patrick projected the ur, ll using the distance and did a range check to see if the points are in the box.It is a close approximation. An ellipses would be closer. Circle is not close enough.\r\n\r\nOK, so I went back to that code and looked and we are doing the same thing (in fact, I based it off of that).  Namely, the only thing that is not working in the code is the interpretation of the results and not the math itself.  To that point, Bill, if you look at the points you gave, it is right on the edge of a box that is centered on that point (roughly, Chippewa Falls, WI), but still outside, of the box that was created by Solr (at 280KM).  I worked this out by viewing the maps at:\r\n1. http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-map.html?lat1=44.936905&long1=-91.392935&lat2=43.09&long2=-93.87341\r\n2. http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-map.html?lat1=44.936905&long1=-91.392935&lat2=45.17614&long2=-93.87341\r\n\r\nThe reason is that we are calculating the box based on the fact that the upper right and lower left corners are 280KM away.  The question is then, is this the intuitive thing app developers expect?  If app developers think in terms of a radius of distance 280km and all points inside, then no, it isn't.  But if they think in terms of the upper and lower box corners with no suggestion of \"radius\", hence implying a circle then it does.  \r\n\r\nSo, one fix for this could solely be a documentation fix.  The other fix is to change the reasoning above to simply find the north, south, east, west points of a box that transcribes a radius of the distance given (since most users tend to think in terms of radius from where they are located and not upper and lower box corners.  This will create a box that encloses said radius completely and might give a slight bit more fuzz up near the box corners due to curvature, but that should be fine.  I'm working on a patch for this fix, as I think it is the better way.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"created":"2010-09-21T19:03:31.663+0000","updated":"2010-09-21T19:03:31.663+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12474641/comment/12913244","id":"12913244","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=billnbell","name":"billnbell","emailAddress":"bell dot william at comcast dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bill Bell","active":true},"body":"OK so that makes sense.

Keep in mind that the approach is meant to be a rough cut for filtering, as it is not 100% accurate.  It is expected that most people would filter based on these range queries, and then do other things to do exact distances later in terms of scoring and sorting.

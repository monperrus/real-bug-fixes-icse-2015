DistributedSpellCheckComponentTest.java runs the test 4 times:  first with 1 shard, then with 2 shards, etc.  In between iterations, it does not clear the Jetty data directories so the first shard from the 2-shard iteration has all the data from the 1-shard iteration, etc.  I can work around this by adding \"del(\"*:*\");\" as the first line in doTest().  Unfortunately doing this makes the test fail.  I think the problem with the Tester is masking a failing test.\r\n\r\n2. The Component ought to report a word as misspelled if *ALL* of the shards report it as not in the dictionary.  However, the current implementation returns a word as misspelled if *ANY* shard reports it as not in the dictionary.\r\n\r\nThis second patch version resolves the second issue.  The problem with the test may warrant its own issue.

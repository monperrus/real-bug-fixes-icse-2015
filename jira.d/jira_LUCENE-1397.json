In this cause,\noptimize() still throws an exception (correctly indicating that the\noptimize() has not finished successfully), but it's not helpful\nbecause it's missing the root cause.  You must then go find the root\ncause in the JRE's stderr logs.\n\nThis has hit a few users on this lists, most recently:\n\n  http://www.nabble.com/Background-merge-hit-exception-td19540409.html#a19540409\n\nI found the isssue, and finally got a unit test to intermittently show\nit.  It's a simple thread safety issue: in a finally clause in\nIndexWriter.merge we record the fact that the merge hit an exception\nbefore actually setting the root cause, and then only in\nConcurrentMergeScheduler's exception handler do we set the root\ncause.  If the optimize thread is scheduled in between these two, it\ncan throw an exception missing its root cause.\n\nThe fix is straightforward.
